## To do
- Remember state, potentially use `edited_at` property of document, for other endpoints simply creation date
- Flatten (or otherwise handle) nested objects, most importantly for documents endpoint
- Transform date-time fields into expected format
- Drop long string fields (e.g. post-boxes.message, documents.text etc.)
- Do metadata properly
